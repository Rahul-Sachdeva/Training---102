        "#### Introduction to Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reusability by enabling a new class to take on the attributes and behaviors of an existing class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Parent Class (Superclass)**:\n",
        "   - Also known as a base class or superclass.\n",
        "   - It's the class whose attributes and methods are inherited by another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Child Class (Subclass)**:\n",
        "   - Also known as a derived class or subclass.\n",
        "   - It inherits attributes and methods from its parent class and can also have its own additional attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance Syntax in Python**:\n",
        "   - In Python, inheritance is declared by specifying the parent class(es) in the definition of a child class.\n",
        "   - Syntax: `class ChildClassName(ParentClassName):`\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Types of Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - **Single Inheritance**: A child class inherits from only one parent class.\n",
        "   - **Multiple Inheritance**: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "   - **Multilevel Inheritance**: One class is derived from another, which is itself derived from another class.\n",
        "   - **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.\n",
        "   - **Hybrid Inheritance**: Combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Advantages of Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Code Reusability**: Avoids redundant code by inheriting from existing classes.\n",
        "- **Modularity**: Promotes a modular approach to software development.\n",
        "- **Ease of Maintenance**: Changes made in the parent class automatically reflect in all child classes (depending on the design).\n",
